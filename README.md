# hanoi_Tower
This code is a simple solution to tower of hanoi challenge

The Tower of Hanoi consists of three towers, in the first tower we will have a certain number of discs, one larger than the other (the largest being at the bottom and decreasing as it goes up). 
The challenge itself consists of passing all the disks in the first tower in the fewest moves and, without placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
In this code model, we ask the user how many disks will be used in the tower and return to the user step by step how it was done
